Priorities:
- determine movement of ParB relative to ParA
    velocity towards ParA as a function of distance?
- determine ParA distribution
    i.e. a peak or homogeneous, and how is this inherited at division
- ParB movement vs diffusion (<(change in x)^2> ~ 2D(change in t)
    plot <(change in x)^2> for all time windows vs time window size?
- determine whether ParB movement is more or less random than expected relative to ParA and the poles (related to above?)

Others:
- cell length / age at ParB split point
- ParB movement vs ParA 'local' gradient
- what is ParA doing when minicells are formed?
- % cells where ParA is not present at the future division place in the frame before division
    requires some sort of local thresholding?
- ParA/B model to predict minicell/anuclear cell frequencies
- arrange cells on heatmaps as a representation of lineage tree rather than having the tree diagram (currently done with Illustrator)
- improvements for spot_process:
    hide button (temporarily hide all spots)
    phase button (switch to phase image with cell outline, toggle button)
