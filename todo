- cell length / age at ParB split point
- ParB movement vs ParA 'local' gradient
- ParB movement vs diffusion (<(change in x)^2> ~ 2D(change in t)
    plot <(change in x)^2> for all time windows vs time window size?
- what is ParA doing when minicells are formed?
- % cells where ParA is not present at the future division place in the frame before division
    requires some sort of local thresholding?
- ParA/B model to predict minicell/anuclear cell frequencies
- arrange cells on heatmaps as a representation of lineage tree rather than having the tree diagram (currently done with Illustrator)
- improvements for spot_process:
    hide button (temporarily hide all spots)
    phase button (switch to phase image with cell outline, toggle button)
