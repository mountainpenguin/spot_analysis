- really make sure daughter cell orientations are correct
- units in um rather than pixels
- remove distance from ParA and pole plots
- 'speed' of ParB: 'moving' and 'static' spots cf. to elongation rate
- define old/new poles: orient all cell plots with new pole at top?
- scale heatmap intensities over all ancestries

- what is ParA doing when minicells are formed?
- % cells where ParA is not present at the future division place in the frame before division

- variation in septum placement
- variation in final size
- asymmetry in ParA partioning -> diff. in fluor and change in fluorescence of each daughter

- cell length at ParB split point
