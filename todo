- fix ParB spot 'lineages'
- plot parA/parB position in parent and daughter cells of lineages (images and graphs)
- combine ParA and ParB plots (ParB superimposed on ParA heatmap, no maximum line)
- remove distance from ParA and pole plots
- 'speed' of ParB: 'moving' and 'static' spots cf. to elongation rate
- define old/new poles

- what is ParA doing when minicells are performed
- % cells where ParA is present at the future septum in the frame before division
- cell length at ParB split point
