- define old/new poles: orient all cell plots with new pole at top?
- really make sure daughter cell orientations are correct
- units in um rather than pixels
- fix network in ancestry plots
- 'speed' of ParB: 'moving' and 'static' spots cf. to elongation rate
- variation in size at division
- variation in septum placement 
    difference in daughter cell size
- % cells where ParA is not present at the future division place in the frame before division
    requires some sort of local thresholding?
- asymmetry in ParA partioning
    diff. in fluor and change in fluorescence of each daughter
- cell length / age at ParB split point
- ParB localisation at division/birth, relative to new pole (septum)
    sum as for ParA
- ParB movement vs ParA 'local' gradient
- ParB movement vs diffusion (<(change in x)^2> ~ 2D(change in t)
    plot <(change in x)^2> for all time windows vs time window size?
- what is ParA doing when minicells are formed?
- scale heatmap intensities over all ancestries
- ParA/B model to predict minicell/anuclear cell frequencies
