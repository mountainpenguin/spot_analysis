* 'speed' of ParB: 'moving' and 'static' spots cf. to elongation rate
- use exponential single-cell growth rate rather than linear growth rate
- scale bar on ParA heatmaps
- arrange cells on heatmaps as a representation of lineage tree rather than having the tree diagram
- number daughter cells on heatmaps
- add initial cell on heatmaps (i.e. show cell at time 0 and time -1)
- units in um rather than pixels
- asymmetry in ParA partioning
    diff. in fluor and change in fluorescence of each daughter
- cell length / age at ParB split point
- ParA localisation: low inheritors vs high inheritors
- ParB localisation at division/birth, relative to new pole (septum)
    sum as for ParA
- ParB movement vs ParA 'local' gradient
- ParB movement vs diffusion (<(change in x)^2> ~ 2D(change in t)
    plot <(change in x)^2> for all time windows vs time window size?
- what is ParA doing when minicells are formed?
- % cells where ParA is not present at the future division place in the frame before division
    requires some sort of local thresholding?
- ParA/B model to predict minicell/anuclear cell frequencies
